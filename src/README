This folder contains two programs, import and query.

import reads data files from geonames.org and preprocesses them to
enable fast queries about geonames. It requires the following files
from http://download.geonames.org/export/dump to reside in the working
directory: countryInfo.txt, allCountries.txt, admin1Codes.txt,
admin2Codes.txt. After preprocessing, import creates a dump file to be
later used by the second program, query.

query uses data generated by import to process queries about populated
places. It reads standard input line by line, printing for each line
no more than 10 places with largest population, which contain tokens
from the input line in their names or related information.
